# Obstacle Avoidance
Obstacle Avoidance is a continued Senior Design 2024-2025 capstone project. This application is designed to assist users, particularly those with visual impairments, in detecting obstacles in their environment using the device's camera. The app provides real-time feedback on detected obstacles and offers customizable settings for a personalized experience. We're currenlty implementing LiDar capabilities to work in tandem with various YOLO models for a measured and accurate reading of obstacles and their distances to users.

Current working demo can be found under the main branch. Any other depracted branches are saved as a reference to previous teams work.
